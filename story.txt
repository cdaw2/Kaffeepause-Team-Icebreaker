He drives the BMW through the streets of Berlin, eventually crashing into a Porsche.
The man dressed in Lederhose (Leather pants) and a Rammstein (German band) band shirt stepped out of the vehicle.
He left his car and went to the baeckerei (bakery) to buy an apfelkuchen (apple cake)
Unfortunately the last apfelkuchen (apple cake) in the whole city was at the flughafen (airport)
The guy yelled at the top of his lungs because he loves Gebaeck (pastries).

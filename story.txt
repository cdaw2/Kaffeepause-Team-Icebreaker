This is a story about a hund (dog) named Wonderbread and his great adventure.
To start his day, Wonderbread tore a hole through his owner's lederhose (leather pants).
He then got ready for the day and put on his favorite dirndel (traditional dress).
Dressed and ready, Wonderbread then proceeded to steal his owner's BMW.
He drove the BMW through the streets of Berlin, eventually crashing into a Porsche.
A man dressed in lederhose (leather pants) and a rammstein (German band) shirt stepped out of the vehicle.
He left his car and went to the baeckerei (bakery) to buy an apfelkuchen (apple cake)
Unfortunately the last apfelkuchen (apple cake) in the whole city was at the flughafen (airport) 
The guy yelled at the top of his lungs because he loves gebaeck (pastries). Putting the crash aside, the man and the hund (dog) hitched a ride with a woman eating a doener (Turkish kebab).
He is very wettbewerbsfaehig (competitive) when it comes to gebaeck eating contests.
